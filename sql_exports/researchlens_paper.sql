developing UNIX in early times has been forgotten due to "fast practices". We
question the leitmotif that microkernels, though being by design adherent to
the KISS principle, have a number of context switches higher than their
monolithic counterparts, running a test suite and verify the results with
standard statistical validation tests. We advocate a wiser distribution of
shared libraries by statistically analyzing the weight of each shared object in
a typical UNIX system, showing that the majority of shared libraries exist in a
common space for no real evidence of need. Finally we examine the UNIX heritage
with an historical point of view, noticing how habits swiftly replaced the
intents of the original authors, moving the focus from the earliest purpose of
is avoiding complications, keeping a system simple to use and maintain.', '2007-01-04', '[]', '[-0.06017099,0.046838872,-0.023709401,-0.03179911,0.038848702,-0.08364485,-0.053174328,0.11424971,0.025379978,0.04179399,-0.026457578,0.01773039,0.052359354,-0.067219846,0.02757821,-0.09869757,-0.025065089,-0.044649627,0.022677034,-0.012882009,-0.11118928,-0.05073097,-0.05820883,-0.0472196,0.020652022,0.07630178,-0.047634263,-0.060906995,0.024358584,-0.016997278,-0.013724207,0.107857354,0.026893714,-0.03386091,-0.012723934,0.0696661,0.11993937,-0.08246016,-0.07211638,-0.003995535,-0.116225615,-0.014755453,-0.03314068,0.07752931,-0.10469452,-0.042425375,0.027603894,-0.053017266,-0.10051157,-0.034400955,-0.0457599,0.003506938,0.049549703,-0.022390824,0.040620327,-0.035430763,-0.036519557,0.020179477,-0.0019485295,0.016704336,0.005776407,-0.018310953,-0.05581329,0.064207874,0.029527029,0.03683046,0.035782997,-0.030191306,0.06946737,0.0055311564,-0.10778783,-0.06739629,-0.040007457,0.11720529,-0.011117087,0.008306994,-0.053097323,0.0020714116,-0.011143945,-0.08647487,-0.024416484,0.043027814,-0.04979603,0.055982616,-0.044426955,0.097286336,0.040733777,0.057462703,-0.006547813,0.004087055,0.08535141,0.006565771,0.060985923,0.018530056,0.009491288,-0.026937477,-0.0059314664,-0.008298921,0.032123122,0.11774674,-0.029006893,0.07167147,0.058805425,0.022703826,0.025178641,-0.040594194,0.022778904,-0.009098694,-0.035973478,-0.030993283,0.011336403,-0.022661071,-0.0795062,-0.017761044,0.042626977,-0.06567628,-0.01946973,-0.01390749,0.029921025,0.06980833,0.02345575,0.022681974,-0.0792852,-0.027836865,0.0015965191,0.0656703,-0.03477955,2.0147082e-33,0.0052285087,-0.016276218,-0.04469673,0.05082421,-0.027854852,-0.03070949,0.03694877,0.059253845,-0.075543046,-0.02360429,0.1654234,0.055458814,-0.021326182,-0.0068532526,0.07475193,-0.01590273,-0.038417295,-0.021902995,0.032338534,-0.029085761,-0.039683785,0.010670491,-0.017182762,-0.047856655,0.044466022,0.023577014,0.029386232,-0.073604144,0.07509371,0.015635462,-0.08608572,-0.09383221,0.0040554143,0.0037320447,-0.0010882571,0.0020924085,0.009437291,-0.10607576,0.007529292,-0.044135172,-0.05404082,0.035003953,-0.008910379,-0.025180524,0.052539144,0.04803921,-0.058017075,-0.0040843035,0.016968591,-0.13650943,0.06734835,0.07596922,0.096450634,0.12707725,-0.006151761,0.013085565,-0.045054857,-0.004172153,0.005260014,0.108391225,0.04266538,0.0645744,0.006709615,0.038723234,0.02133005,0.023651564,-0.011223987,0.068088785,-0.014423174,0.08192521,-0.04636285,0.0075592753,-0.061566062,0.04616195,-0.0024985813,0.032479174,-0.029770464,-0.035056684,-0.0013114986,-0.050162364,0.05256655,0.018881429,-0.011742916,0.017224759,-0.0048556216,0.003973414,-0.0015394524,-0.028286716,-0.120588854,0.012084804,0.034472108,0.019836891,0.04344838,0.018700069,-0.10243251,-4.055077e-33,-0.011563689,-0.08130945,-0.009995494,0.1118728,-0.08236795,0.059660837,-0.058202215,-0.12144039,-0.07993423,-0.008338085,-0.010695859,-0.019715827,0.0801895,-0.04944911,0.0018258701,0.022656411,-0.011375099,-0.07844347,0.0061902422,0.005052108,0.019556481,0.071228504,-0.017936299,-0.006028096,-0.028521603,-0.041075204,-0.049457237,-0.012203396,-0.07204339,-0.014579942,0.035648122,-0.0337285,0.0073059886,-0.033873044,0.053578254,-0.00030062077,-0.022367815,0.079148,-0.004886406,-0.035249878,0.035159912,-0.0045462693,-0.06702493,-0.034949057,-0.009420631,0.047159415,-0.1131907,-0.002667476,0.002469075,-0.1005108,0.0028315913,-0.0027274434,0.04822343,-0.10195986,-0.046049632,0.007332057,-0.035362925,0.043319907,0.07289888,0.0895626,0.010905255,-0.033157036,-0.03189756,0.02359449,-0.0062618805,-0.04842655,-0.002865263,0.03217624,-0.054983806,-0.0028574984,0.09168058,0.015756715,-0.08735639,0.0009272697,0.008974018,0.108060665,0.08520742,-0.07882036,-0.048766952,0.039868582,-0.05784507,0.057823095,-0.0139697725,0.042726282,-0.022915462,0.04649088,0.0038242815,-0.018024059,-0.04013138,0.023439143,-0.014722093,0.0145125855,-0.058561854,0.027051907,-0.027865933,-4.9863836e-08,0.062228415,-0.024235435,-0.004186784,0.06711258,0.059115987,0.05718181,0.014192321,0.011115738,-0.052705765,0.08932027,0.026185649,-0.09641915,-0.07615994,0.029077446,0.04859466,0.08447531,-0.0148336105,0.0012231604,-0.081833966,0.02648644,0.07486758,0.036808606,0.04145895,-0.004094644,-0.058361795,0.014622568,0.07428896,0.05657944,0.04291992,0.044553325,0.029885607,0.025392545,-0.06430609,-0.0101262,0.010131525,0.021332398,-0.04952938,0.08091969,0.03822145,-0.020463042,-0.047657605,-0.011590943,-0.015941894,0.03355027,-0.055863183,-0.01714259,-0.1044442,0.059606813,-0.07161961,-0.0066879033,0.044415776,-0.017168306,-0.0036240558,0.10336427,0.060811535,-0.026477745,-0.034111783,0.004356004,0.008736596,0.005591727,0.021070443,0.029714774,0.03673346,0.03398547]', 'Computer Science', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0701021v2');

application behavior. However, existing system call interception tools on the
ARM platform still suffer from limitations in terms of performance and
completeness. This paper presents an efficient and comprehensive binary
rewriting framework, ASC-Hook, specifically designed for intercepting system
calls on the ARM platform. ASC-Hook addresses two key challenges on the ARM
architecture: the misalignment of the target address caused by directly
replacing the SVC instruction with br x8, and the return to the original
control flow after system call interception. This is achieved through a hybrid
replacement strategy and our specially designed trampoline mechanism. By
implementing multiple completeness strategies specifically for system calls, we
ensured comprehensive and thorough interception. Experimental results show that
ASC-Hook reduces overhead to at least 1/29 of that of existing system call

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (1, '9904016v1', 'Brittle System Analysis', e'The goal of this paper is to define and analyze systems which exhibit brittle
behavior. This behavior is characterized by a sudden and steep decline in
performance as the system approaches the limits of tolerance. This can be due

  Computers and Human Cognition', e'Issues related to a materialist philosophy are explored as concerns the
implied equivalence of computers running software and human observers. One
issue explored concerns the measurement process in quantum mechanics. Another
issue explored concerns the nature of experience as revealed by the existence
of dreams. Some difficulties stemming from a materialist philosophy as regards
these issues are pointed out. For example, a gedankenexperiment involving what
has been called "negative" observation is discussed that illustrates the
difficulty with a materialist assumption in quantum mechanics. Based on an

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (8, '9911005v1', 'What Next? A Dozen Information-Technology Research Goals', e'Charles Babbage\'s vision of computing has largely been realized. We are on
the verge of realizing Vannevar Bush\'s Memex. But, we are some distance from
passing the Turing Test. These three visions and their associated problems have
provided long-range research goals for many of us. For example, the scalability
problem has motivated me for several decades. This talk defines a set of
fundamental research problems that broaden the Babbage, Bush, and Turing
visions. They extend Babbage\'s computational goal to include highly-secure,
highly-available, self-programming, self-managing, and self-replicating
systems. They extend Bush\'s Memex vision to include a system that automatically
organizes, indexes, digests, evaluates, and summarizes information (as well as
a human might). Another group of problems extends Turing\'s vision of

processes, and organizations will be online. This trend is both desirable and
inevitable. Cyberspace will provide the basis for wonderful new ways to inform,
entertain, and educate people. The information and the corresponding systems
will streamline commerce, but will also provide new levels of personal service,
health care, and automation. The most significant benefit will be a
breakthrough in our ability to remotely communicate with one another using all
our senses.
  The ACM and the transistor were born in 1947. At that time the stored program
computer was a revolutionary idea and the transistor was just a curiosity. Both
ideas evolved rapidly. By the mid 1960s integrated circuits appeared --
allowing mass fabrication of transistors on silicon substrates. This allowed
low-cost mass-produced computers. These technologies enabled extraordinary
increases in processing speed and memory coupled with extraordinary price
declines.
  The only form of processing and memory more easily, cheaply, and rapidly
fabricated is the human brain. Peter Cohrane (1996) estimates the brain to have
a processing power of around 1000 million-million operations per second, (one

describe the response behaviors of individuals to a set of items having a
certain number of options. They are adopted by researchers in social science,
particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data, in psychology,
education, medicine, marketing and other fields where the aim is to measure
latent constructs. Most IRT analyses use parametric models that rely on
assumptions that often are not satisfied. In such cases, a nonparametric
approach might be preferable; nevertheless, there are not many software
applications allowing to use that. To address this gap, this paper presents the
R package KernSmoothIRT. It implements kernel smoothing for the estimation of
option characteristic curves, and adds several plotting and analytical tools to

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (4, '2207.01849v1', e'Learnings from an Under the Hood Analysis of an Object Storage Node IO
  Stack', e'Conventional object-stores are built on top of traditional OS storage stack,
where I/O requests typically transfers through multiple hefty and redundant
layers. The complexity of object management has grown dramatically with the
ever increasing requirements of performance, consistency and fault-tolerance
from storage subsystems. Simply stated, more number of intermediate layers are
encountered in the I/O data path, with each passing layer adding its own syntax
and semantics. Thereby increasing the overheads of request processing. In this
paper, through comprehensive under-the-hood analysis of an object-storage node,
we characterize the impact of object-store (and user-application) workloads on
the OS I/O stack and its subsequent rippling effect on the underlying
object-storage devices (OSD). We observe that the legacy architecture of the OS
based I/O storage stack coupled with complex data management policies leads to
a performance mismatch between what an end-storage device is capable of
delivering and what it actually delivers in a production environment.
Therefore, the gains derived from developing faster storage devices is often
nullified. These issues get more pronounced in highly concurrent and
multiplexed cloud environments. Owing to the associated issues of
object-management and the vulnerabilities of the OS I/O software stacks, we
discuss the potential of a new class of storage devices, known as
Object-Drives. Samsung Key-Value SSD (KV-SSD) [1] and Seagate Kinetic Drive [2]
are classic industrial implementations of object-drives, where host data
management functionalities can be offloaded to the storage device. This leads
towards the simplification of the over-all storage stack. Based on our

behavioral restrictions in the form of solution concepts, such as Nash
equilibrium. Choosing the right solution concept is crucial not just for
identification of payoff parameters, but also for the validity and
informativeness of counterfactual exercises and policy implications. We say
that a solution concept is discernible if it is possible to determine whether
it generated the observed data on the players\' behavior and covariates. We
propose a set of conditions that make it possible to discern solution concepts.
In particular, our conditions are sufficient to tell whether the players\'
choices emerged from Nash equilibria. We can also discern between

particular narrative which links locales, geometric theories, sheaf semantics
and constructive commutative algebra. We are hoping to convey a firm grasp of
three ideas: (1) Locales are a kind of space in which opens instead of points

been found to successfully explain U.S. stock returns. Our paper adopts a
recursive preference utility framework to derive an heterogeneous asset pricing
model with capital share risks.While modeling capital share risks, we account
for the elevated consumption volatility of high income stockholders. Capital
risks have strong volatility effects in our recursive asset pricing model.

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (12, '2412.05250v1', 'Constructing projective modules', e'We discuss elements of a social history of the theory of projective modules
over commutative rings. We attempt to study the question: how did the theory of
projective modules become one of "mainstream" focus in mathematics? To do this,
we begin in what one might call the pre-history of projective modules,
describing the mathematical culture into which the notion of projective module
was released. These recollections involve four pieces: (a) analyzing aspects of
the theory of fiber bundles, as it impinges on algebraic geometry, (b)
understanding the rise of homological techniques in algebraic topology, (c)
describing the influence of category-theoretic ideas in topology and algebra
and (d) revisiting the story of the percolation of sheaf-theoretic ideas
through algebraic geometry.
  We will then argue that it was this unique confluence of mathematical events
that allowed projective modules to emerge as objects of central mathematical
importance. More precisely, we will first argue that, in the context of social
currents of the time, projective modules initially were isolated as objects of
purely technical convenience reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities of the
creators of the fledgling theory of homological algebra. Only later did they
transcend this limited role to become objects of "mainstream importance" due to
influence from the theory of algebraic fiber bundles and the theory of sheaves.
Along the way, we aim to show how strong personal ties emanating from the

topological spaces from algebraic data. Given a commutative localic semiring R
(the pointfree analogue of a topological semiring), we define a spectrum of R
which generalises the Stone spectrum of a distributive lattice, the Zariski
spectrum of a commutative ring, the Gelfand spectrum of a commutative unital
C*-algebra and the Hofmann-Lawson spectrum of a continuous frame. We then
provide an explicit construction of this spectrum under conditions on R which
are satisfied by our main examples.
  Our results are constructively valid and hence admit interpretation in any
elementary topos with natural number object. For this reason the spectrum we
construct should actually be a locale instead of a topological space.
  A simple modification to our construction gives rise to a quantic spectrum in
the form of a commutative quantale. Such a quantale contains `differential\'
information in addition to the purely topological information of the localic
spectrum. In the case of a discrete ring, our construction produces the
quantale of ideals.
  This prompts us to study the quantale of ideals in more detail. We discuss

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (16, '0509245v2', 'Analysis in J_2', e'This is an expository paper in which I explain how core mathematics,
particularly abstract analysis, can be developed within a concrete countable
set J_2 (the second set in Jensen\'s constructible hierarchy). The implication,
well-known to proof theorists but probably not to most mainstream
mathematicians, is that ordinary mathematical practice does not require an
enigmatic metaphysical universe of sets. I go further and argue that J_2 is a

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (15, '0409250v3', 'Von Neumann coordinatization is not first-order', e'A lattice L is coordinatizable, if it is isomorphic to the lattice L(R) of
principal right ideals of some von Neumann regular ring R. This forces L to be
complemented modular. All known sufficient conditions for coordinatizability,
due first to J. von Neumann, then to B. Jonsson, are first-order. Nevertheless,
we prove that coordinatizability of lattices is not first-order, by finding a
non-coordinatizable lattice K with a coordinatizable countable elementary
extension L. This solves a 1960 problem of B. Jonsson. We also prove that there
is no L\\_{infinity, infinity} statement equivalent to coordinatizability.

  and Tsuboi\'s metric', e'Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal
coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively
simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show
that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are
relatively simple, including the universal covering
$\\widetilde{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$.
  Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We
generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (18, '2112.11552v2', 'Brackets and products from centres in extension categories', e'Building on Retakh\'s approach to Ext groups through categories of extensions,
Schwede reobtained the well-known Gerstenhaber algebra structure on Ext groups
over bimodules of associative algebras both from splicing extensions (leading
to the cup product) and from a suitable loop in the categories of extensions
(leading to the Lie bracket). We show how Schwede\'s construction admits a vast
generalisation to general monoidal categories with coefficients of the Ext
groups taken in (weak) left and right monoidal (or Drinfel\'d) centres. In case
of the category of left modules over bialgebroids and coefficients given by
commuting pairs of braided (co)commutative (co)monoids in these categorical
centres, we provide an explicit description of the algebraic structure obtained
this way, and a complete proof that this leads to a Gerstenhaber algebra is
then obtained from an operadic approach. This, in particular, considerably
generalises the classical construction given by Gerstenhaber himself.
Conjecturally, the algebraic structure we describe should produce a
Gerstenhaber algebra for an arbitrary monoidal category enriched over abelian

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (19, '1810.02941v2', 'The twisting procedure', e'This paper provides a conceptual study of the twisting procedure, which
amounts to create functorially new differential graded Lie algebras,
associative algebras or operads (as well as their homotopy versions) from a
Maurer--Cartan element. On the way, we settle the integration theory of
complete pre-Lie algebras in order to describe this twisting procedure in terms
of gauge group action. We give a criterion on quadratic operads for the
existence of a meaningful twisting procedure of their associated categories of

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (14, '2506.17982v1', 'Projective length, phantom extensions, and the structure of flat modules', e'We consider the natural generalization of the notion of the order of a
phantom map from the topological setting to triangulated categories. When
applied to the derived category of the category of countable flat modules over
a countable Dedekind domain, this yields a notion of\\emph{\\ phantom extension}
of order $\\alpha <\\omega _{1}$. We provide a complexity-theoretic
characterization of the module $\\mathrm{Ph}% ^{\\alpha }\\mathrm{Ext}\\left(
C,A\\right) $ of phantom extensions of order $\\alpha $ with respect to the
structure of \\emph{phantom Polish module} on $\\mathrm{Ext}\\left( C,A\\right) $
obtained by considering it as an object of the left heart of the quasi-abelian
category of Polish modules. We use this characterization to prove the following
Dichotomy Theorem: either all the extensions of a countable flat module $A$ are
trivial (which happens precisely when $A$ is divisible) or $A$ has phantom
extensions of arbitrarily high order.
  By producing canonical phantom projective resolutions of order $\\alpha $, we
prove that phantom extensions of order $\\alpha $ define on the category of
countable flat modules an exact structure $\\mathcal{E}_{\\alpha }$ that is
hereditary with enough projectives, and the functor $\\mathrm{Ph}^{\\alpha }%
\\mathrm{Ext}$ is the derived functor of $\\mathrm{Hom}$ with respect to
$\\mathcal{E}_{\\alpha }$. We prove a Structure Theorem characterizing the
objects of the class $\\mathcal{P}_{\\alpha }$ of countable flat modules that
have \\emph{projective length at most }$\\alpha $ (i.e., are $\\mathcal{E}_{\\alpha
}$-projective) as the direct summands of colimits of presheaves of finite flat

geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. It offers a conceptual,
exhaustive and gentle treatment of the twisting procedure, which functorially
creates new differential graded Lie algebras, associative algebras or operads
(as well as their homotopy versions) from a Maurer-Cartan element. The twisting
procedure for (homotopy) associative algebras or (homotopy) Lie algebras is
described by means of the action of the biggest deformation gauge group ever
considered. We give a criterion on quadratic operads for the existence of a
meaningful twisting procedure of their associated categories of algebras. And,
we introduce the twisting procedure for operads \\`a la Willwacher using a new
and simpler presentation, which provides us with a wide source of motivating
examples related to graph homology, both recovering known graph complexes (due
to Kontsevich) and introducing some new ones. This book starts with elementary
surveys on gauge theory and deformation theory using differential graded Lie
algebras in order to ease the way to the theory. It finishes with concise
surveys on the fundamental theorem of deformation theory, higher Lie theory,

  Adaptive Discrete Beta Kernel Techniques', e'Kernel smoothing represents a useful approach in the graduation of mortality
rates. Though there exist several options for performing kernel smoothing in
statistical software packages, there have been very few contributions to date
that have focused on applications of these techniques in the graduation
context. Also, although it has been shown that the use of a variable or
adaptive smoothing parameter, based on the further information provided by the
exposed to the risk of death, provides additional benefits, specific
computational tools for this approach are essentially absent. Furthermore,
little attention has been given to providing methods in available software for
any kind of subsequent analysis with respect to the graduated mortality rates.
To facilitate analyses in the field, the R package DBKGrad is introduced. Among
the available kernel approaches, it considers a recent discrete beta kernel
estimator, in both its fixed and adaptive variants. In this approach, boundary
bias is automatically reduced and age is pragmatically considered as a discrete
variable. The bandwidth, fixed or adaptive, is allowed to be manually given by
the user or selected by cross-validation. Pointwise confidence intervals, for

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (24, '2204.02344v1', 'Bayesian Quantile Regression for Longitudinal Count Data', e'This work introduces Bayesian quantile regression modeling framework for the
analysis of longitudinal count data. In this model, the response variable is
not continuous and hence an artificial smoothing of counts is incorporated. The
Bayesian implementation utilizes the normal-exponential mixture representation
of the asymmetric Laplace distribution for the response variable. An efficient
Gibbs sampling algorithm is derived for fitting the model to the data. The

  extensible MATLAB suite', e'Many statistical problems and applications require repeated computation of
order statistics, such as the median, but most statistical and programming
environments do not offer in their main distribution linear selection
algorithms. We introduce one, formally equivalent to quickselect, which keeps
the position of the pivot fixed. This makes the implementation simpler and much
practical compared with the best known solutions. It also enables an "oracular"
pivot position option that can reduce a lot the convergence time of certain
statistical applications. We have extended the algorithm to weighted
percentiles such as the weighted median, applicable to data associated with
varying precision measurements, image filtering, descriptive statistics like
the medcouple and for combining multiple predictors in boosting algorithms. We

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (23, '2101.07710v1', e'The effect of Hybrid Principal Components Analysis on the Signal
  Compression Functional Regression: With EEG-fMRI Application', e'Objective: In some situations that exist both scalar and functional data,
called mixed and hybrid data, the hybrid PCA (HPCA) was introduced. Among the
regression models for the hybrid data, we can count covariate-adjusted HPCA,
the Semi-functional partial linear regression, function-on-function (FOF)
regression with signal compression, and functional additive regression, models.
In this article, we study the effects of HPCA decomposition of hybrid data on
the prediction accuracy of the FOF regression with signal compressions. Method:
We stated a two-step procedure for incorporating the HPCA in the functional
regressions. The first step is reconstructing the data based on the HPCAs and
the second step is merging data on the other dimensions and calculate the
point-wise average of the desired functional dimension. We also choose the
number of HPCA based on Mean Squared Perdition Error (MSPE). Result: In the two
simulations, we show that the regression models with the first HPCA have the
best accuracy prediction and model fit summaries among no HPCA and all HPCAs
with a training/testing approach. Finally, we applied our methodology to the
EEG-fMRI dataset. Conclusions: We conclude that our methodology improves the
prediction of the experiments with the EEG datasets. And we recommend that

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (49, '0907.5140v2', 'Climate Engineering Responses to Climate Emergencies', e'Despite efforts to stabilize CO_2 concentrations, it is possible that the
climate system could respond abruptly with catastrophic consequences.
Intentional intervention in the climate system to avoid or ameliorate such
consequences has been proposed as one possible response, should such a scenario
arise. In a one-week study, the authors of this report conducted a technical
review and evaluation of proposed climate engineering concepts that might serve
as a rapid palliative response to such climate emergency scenarios.
  Because of their potential to induce a prompt (less than one year) global
cooling, this study concentrated on Shortwave Climate Engineering (SWCE)
methods for moderately reducing the amount of shortwave solar radiation
reaching the Earth. The study\'s main objective was to outline a decade-long
agenda of technical research that would maximally reduce the uncertainty
surrounding the benefits and risks associated with SWCE. For rigor of technical

  Load Forecasting', e'We present a simple quantile regression-based forecasting method that was
applied in a probabilistic load forecasting framework of the Global Energy
Forecasting Competition 2017 (GEFCom2017). The hourly load data is log
transformed and split into a long-term trend component and a remainder term.
The key forecasting element is the quantile regression approach for the
remainder term that takes into account weekly and annual seasonalities such as
their interactions. Temperature information is only used to stabilize the
forecast of the long-term trend component. Public holidays information is
ignored. Still, the forecasting method placed second in the open data track and

  Attachment Models', e'In this paper we develop an Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm to
estimate the parameter of a Yule-Simon distribution. The Yule-Simon
distribution exhibits the "rich get richer" effect whereby an 80-20 type of
rule tends to dominate. These distributions are ubiquitous in industrial
settings. The EM algorithm presented provides both frequentist and Bayesian
estimates of the $\\lambda$ parameter. By placing the estimation method within
the EM framework we are able to derive Standard errors of the resulting
estimate. Additionally, we prove convergence of the Yule-Simon EM algorithm and

robust statistics is generally not analytically solvable. While the Monte Carlo
method can provide approximate solutions, its convergence rate is typically
very slow, making the computational cost to achieve the desired accuracy
unaffordable for ordinary users. In this paper, we propose an approach
analogous to the Fourier transformation to decompose the finite sample
structure of the uniform distribution. By obtaining sets of sequences that are
consistent with parametric distributions for the first four sample moments, we
can approximate the finite sample behavior of other estimators with

  detection', e'Advances in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled the
high-throughput profiling of metagenomes and accelerated the microbiome study.
Recently, there has been a rise in quantitative studies that aim to decipher
the microbiome co-occurrence network and its underlying community structure
based on metagenomic sequence data. Uncovering the complex microbiome community
structure is essential to understanding the role of the microbiome in disease
progression and susceptibility. Taxonomic abundance data generated from
metagenomic sequencing technologies are high-dimensional and compositional,
suffering from uneven sampling depth, over-dispersion, and zero-inflation.
These characteristics often challenge the reliability of the current methods
for microbiome community detection. To this end, we propose a Bayesian
stochastic block model to study the microbiome co-occurrence network based on
the recently developed modified centered-log ratio transformation tailored for
microbiome data analysis. Our model allows us to incorporate taxonomic tree
information using a Markov random field prior. The model parameters are jointly
inferred by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Our simulation
study showed that the proposed approach performs better than competing methods
even when taxonomic tree information is non-informative. We applied our
approach to a real urinary microbiome dataset from postmenopausal women, the

  Psychometric Simulations', e'We introduce Bhirkuti\'s Test of Bias Acceptance (BTBA), a standardized
framework for evaluating estimator bias in Monte Carlo simulation studies. BTBA
uses a simulation-specific standardized score (Z*) and a decision matrix to
assess bias acceptability based on the mean and variance of Z* distributions.
Under ideal conditions, Z* values should approximate a standard normal
distribution (Z-distribution) with a mean near zero and variance near one in
the context of simulation research. Systematic deviations from these patterns
such as shifted means or inflated variances indicate bias or estimator
instability in simulation-based research. BTBA visualizes these patterns using
ridgeline density plots, which reveal distributional features such as central
tendency, spread, skewness, and outliers. Demonstrated in a latent growth
modeling context, BTBA offers a reproducible and interpretable method for
diagnosing bias across varying simulation conditions. By addressing key
limitations of traditional relative bias (RB) metrics, BTBA provides a
theoretically grounded, distribution-aware, transparent, and replicable
alternative for evaluating estimator quality, particularly in psychometric

structures often deprived of micro-foundations. Both models are limited when
analyzing interim results or performing empirical analysis. We present a method
of generating signal structures which are richer than the binary model, yet are
tractable enough to perform simulations and empirical analysis. We demonstrate
the method\'s usability by revisiting two classical papers: (1) we discuss the
economic significance of unbounded signals Smith and Sorensen (2000); (2) we

  equations', e'This paper derives conditions under which preferences and technology are
nonparametrically identified in hedonic equilibrium models, where products are
differentiated along more than one dimension and agents are characterized by
several dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity. With products differentiated
along a quality index and agents characterized by scalar unobserved
heterogeneity, single crossing conditions on preferences and technology provide
identifying restrictions in Ekeland, Heckman and Nesheim (2004) and Heckman,
Matzkin and Nesheim (2010). We develop similar shape restrictions in the
multi-attribute case. These shape restrictions, which are based on optimal
transport theory and generalized convexity, allow us to identify preferences
for goods differentiated along multiple dimensions, from the observation of a
single market. We thereby derive nonparametric identification results for
nonseparable simultaneous equations and multi-attribute hedonic equilibrium

sufficient conditions for convergence to a unique underlying "true" preference.
Our conditions are weak, and therefore valid in a wide range of economic

instance a search engine ranking webpages given past searches. Resampling past
cases leads to different rankings and the extraction of deeper information. Yet
a rich database, with sufficiently diverse rankings, is often beyond reach.
Inexperience demands either "on the fly" learning-by-doing or prudence: the
arrival of a novel case does not force (i) a revision of current rankings, (ii)
dogmatism towards new rankings, or (iii) intransitivity. For this higher-order
framework of inductive inference, we derive a suitably unique numerical
representation of these rankings via a matrix on eventualities x cases and

among professional astronomers, scientific and academic institutions, and the
general public. Despite its provenance and identification having been
questioned in the early part of the last century, this painting has reached
iconic status. We review its history from its first mention in the literature
in the 1870s to a published but virtually unknown judgment of competent art
experts of the 1920s that the work is in fact an early nineteenth century
forgery. We display the painting in context with other more secure portraits

  of Profit: The United States Case (1960-2020)', e'The long-term estimation of the Marxist average rate of profit does not
adhere to a theoretically grounded standard regarding which economic activities
should or should not be included for such purposes, which is relevant because
methodological non-uniformity can be a significant source of overestimation or
underestimation, generating a less accurate reflection of the capital
accumulation dynamics. This research aims to provide a standard Marxist
decision criterion regarding the inclusion and exclusion of economic activities
for the calculation of the Marxist average profit rate for the case of United
States economic sectors from 1960 to 2020, based on the Marxist definition of
productive labor, its location in the circuit of capital, and its relationship
with the production of surplus value. Using wavelet-transformed Daubechies
filters with increased symmetry, empirical mode decomposition, Hodrick-Prescott
filter embedded in unobserved components model, and a wide variety of unit root
tests the internal theoretical consistency of the presented criteria is
evaluated. Also, the objective consistency of the theory is evaluated by a
dynamic factor auto-regressive model, Principal Component Analysis, Singular

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (39, '2006.14243v1', 'Matching Multidimensional Types: Theory and Application', e'Becker (1973) presents a bilateral matching model in which scalar types
describe agents. For this framework, he establishes the conditions under which
positive sorting between agents\' attributes is the unique market outcome.
Becker\'s celebrated sorting result has been applied to address many economic
questions. However, recent empirical studies in the fields of health,
household, and labor economics suggest that agents have multiple
outcome-relevant attributes. In this paper, I study a matching model with
multidimensional types. I offer multidimensional generalizations of concordance
and supermodularity to construct three multidimensional sorting patterns and
two classes of multidimensional complementarities. For each of these sorting
patterns, I identify the sufficient conditions which guarantee its optimality.
In practice, we observe sorting patterns between observed attributes that are
aggregated over unobserved characteristics. To reconcile theory with practice,
I establish the link between production complementarities and the aggregated
sorting patterns. Finally, I examine the relationship between agents\' health
status and their spouses\' education levels among U.S. households within the
framework for multidimensional matching markets. Preliminary analysis reveals a
weak positive association between agents\' health status and their spouses\'
education levels. This weak positive association is estimated to be a product
of three factors: (a) an attraction between better-educated individuals, (b) an
attraction between healthier individuals, and (c) a weak positive association

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (37, '2006.01852v3', 'Subjective Complexity Under Uncertainty', e'Complexity of the problem of choosing among uncertain acts is a salient
feature of many of the environments in which departures from expected utility
theory are observed. I propose and axiomatize a model of choice under
uncertainty in which the size of the partition with respect to which an act is
measurable arises endogenously as a measure of subjective complexity. I derive
a representation of incomplete Simple Bounds preferences in which acts that are
complex from the perspective of the decision maker are bracketed by simple acts
to which they are related by statewise dominance. The key axioms are motivated
by a model of learning from limited data. I then consider choice behavior
characterized by a "cautious completion" of Simple Bounds preferences, and

diffusion (Brownian) signals, where the decision maker accumulates evidence
until the process hits a stopping boundary, and then stops and chooses the
alternative that corresponds to that boundary. This model has been widely used
in psychology, neuroeconomics, and neuroscience to explain the observed
patterns of choice and response times in a range of binary choice decision
problems. This paper provides a statistical test for DDM\'s with general
boundaries. We first prove a characterization theorem: we find a condition on
choice probabilities that is satisfied if and only if the choice probabilities

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (47, '2407.00234v1', e'Medium-scale thermospheric gravity waves in the high-resolution Whole
  Atmosphere Model: Seasonal, local time, and longitudinal variations', e'This paper presents a study of the global medium-scale (scales<620 km)
gravity wave (GW) activity (in terms of zonal wind variance) and its seasonal,
local time and longitudinal variations by employing the enhanced-resolution
(~50 km) Whole Atmosphere Model (WAMT254) and space-based observations for
geomagnetically quiet conditions. It is found that the GW hotspots produced by
WAMT254 in the troposphere and stratosphere agree well with previously
well-studied orographic and non-orographic sources. In the
ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) region, GWs spread out forming latitudinal
band-like hotspots. During solstices, a primary maximum in GW activity is
observed in WAMT254 and GOCE over winter mid-high latitudes, likely associated
with higher-order waves with primary sources in polar night jet, fronts and
polar vortex. During all the seasons, the enhancement of GWs around the
geomagnetic poles as observed by GOCE (at ~250 km) is well captured by
simulations. WAMT254 GWs in the IT region also show dependence on local time
due to their interaction with migrating tides leading to diurnal and
semidiurnal variations. The GWs are more likely to propagate up from the MLT
region during westward/weakly-eastward phase of thermospheric tides, signifying
the dominance of eastward GW momentum flux in the MLT. Additionally, as a novel
finding, a wavenumber-4 signature in GW activity is predicted by WAMT254

of different acid molecules with a single water molecule. The molecular and
supermolecular optimized structures were found with the Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr
(B3LYP-hybrid potential) calculations of density-functional theory (DFT)
methods as well as the Moeller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory, using
the basis set of Aug-cc-pVDZ quality and the CRENBL ECP effective core
potential for molecules containing heavy iodine atom. Possible isomers of
studied acids and supermolecules, consisting of acid molecules coupled with a
single water molecule, are shown. Energies, zero-point energies (ZPEs), thermal
enthalpies and free energies, as well as the corresponding binding energies for
the theoretical methods were calculated. It was found that optimized structures
of supermolecular isomers with lowest energies corresponding to the global
minimum on the potential energy surfaces can be different for both theories.
The simplest structure acids H2S and H2Se, forming acid-water supermolecules,
can give clear evidence of disagreement of the two theoretical methods
concerning optimization of lowest energy structures, because the B3LYP-DFT
method gives the lowest-energy structure for the first supermolecular isomer,
but the MP2 method for the second possible isomer. A dramatic difference
between potential energy surfaces for both theories applying to the optimized
structure finding of the H2SO3-H2O supermolecular isomers was found, because
MP2 supermolecular geometries cannot exist for the corresponding B3LYP-DFT

coastlines and in oceans, and the current theory (termed the gravitational
forcing mechanism) explains them as a manifestation of the response of ocean
water to the Moon\'s (Sun\'s) gravitational force. However, although the purely
hydrodynamic models representing the current theory have been widely tested
over global ocean,their tidal elevation accuracies are generally low. This
implies an uncertainty as to whether the gravitational forcing mechanism is the
best explanation for tides. In this study, we present a new theory (termed the
oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism), in which tides are explained as a
manifestation of oscillating ocean basin that is intricately linked to the
elongated spinning solid Earth due to the Moon (Sun). Based on this new theory,
we develop an algebraic tide model and test it using 11-year observations from
33 bottom pressure stations over the Pacific Ocean, the average Root Mean
Square (RMS) deviation of tidal elevation predicted by this model against
observation is 7.54 cm. Using a ratio of M2 elevation RMS of ocean tide model
EOT11a and its total tidal elevation RMS as a reference, we estimate the total
tidal elevation RMS of six purely hydrodynamic models (i.e.,Hallberg Isopycnal

  and Research', e'Physics plays a fundamental role in advancing pharmacy education and
research, providing theoretical underpinnings and practical tools necessary to
address complex challenges in drug development, delivery, and diagnostics. This
review explores the integration of physics into the pharmacy curriculum,
highlighting how principles such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and
spectroscopy (Tokgoz and Sakalli, 2018) enhance students\' critical thinking and
problem-solving skills. Additionally, it examines the pivotal contributions of
physics to pharmaceutical research, including molecular modeling, imaging
technologies like MRI and PET, and nanotechnology-driven drug delivery systems.
Despite challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration and resource allocation,
innovative teaching strategies and laboratory based learning are shown
significant promise. Looking forward, the convergence of artificial
intelligence and physics, as highlighted by recent Nobel Prize achievements in

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (41, '2305.09528v1', e'German to Spanish translation of Einstein\'s work on the formation of
  meanders in rivers', e'In 1926 Albert Einstein gave a clear explanation of the physical processes
involved in the meander formation and evolution in open channels (Einstein,
1926). Although this work is far from being recognized as one of his greatest
achievements, such as his annus mirabilis papers in 1905, he shows a truly
remarkable didactic skills that make it easy to understand even to the
non-specialist. In particular, a brilliant explanation of the tea leaf paradox
can be found in this paper of 1926, presented as a simple experiment for
clarifying the role of Earth rotation and flow curvature in the differential
river banks erosion. This work deserves to be considered as a pioneering work
that has laid a basic knowledge in currently very active research fields in
fluvial geomorphology, estuarine physics, and hydraulic engineering. In
response to the curiosity aroused and transmitted to the authors over the years
by undergraduates and MSc. students, and also due to its historical and
scientific significance, we present here the Spanish translation of Einstein\'s

INSERT INTO public.researchlens_paper (id, arxiv_id, title, abstract, published_date, keywords, embedding, categories, link) VALUES (50, '1508.01805v2', e'Revealing pre-earthquake signatures in atmosphere and ionosphere
  associated with 2015 M7.8 and M7.3 events in Nepal. Preliminary results', e'We analyze retrospectively/prospectively the transient variations of three
different physical parameters of atmosphere during the time of M7.8 and M7.3
events in Nepal: outgoing earth radiation (OLR), GPS/TEC and the thermodynamic
proprieties in the lower atmosphere. We found that in mid March 2015 a rapid
augment of satellite observed earth radiation in atmosphere and the anomaly
located in close vicinity to the future M7.8 epicenter reached the maximum on
April 21-22. Our continuous satellite analysis revealed prospectively the new
strong anomaly on May 3th, which was the reason to contemplate another large
event in the area. On May 12, 2015 a large aftershock of M7.3 occurred. The
analysis of air temperature from weather ground station near Katmandu shows
analogous patterns with offset 1-2 days earlier to the satellite anomalies. The
GPS/TEC data analysis indicates an augment and variation in electron density
reaching a maximum value during April 22-24 period. A strong negative TEC
anomaly in the crest of EIA (Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly) has occurred on

impressive progress in live imaging and quantitative physical descriptions of
cytoskeletal network dynamics, the connection between processes at molecular
scales and cell-scale spatio-temporal patterns is still unclear. Here we review
studies reporting acto-myosin clusters of micrometer size and with lifetimes of
several minutes in a large number of organisms ranging from fission yeast to
humans. Such structures have also been found in reconstituted systems in vitro
and in theoretical analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics. We propose that tracking

  strain 91001', e'The gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis, the aetiological agent of
bubonic plague, is one the deadliest pathogens known to man. Despite its
historical reputation, plague is a modern disease which annually afflicts
thousands of people. Public safety considerations greatly limit clinical
experimentation on this organism and thus development of theoretical tools to
analyze the capabilities of this pathogen is of utmost importance. Here, we
report the first genome-scale metabolic model of Yersinia pestis biovar
Mediaevalis based both on its recently annotated genome, and physiological and
biochemical data from literature. Our model demonstrates excellent agreement
with Y. pestis known metabolic needs and capabilities. Since Y. pestis is a
meiotrophic organism, we have developed CryptFind, a systematic approach to
identify all candidate cryptic genes responsible for known and theoretical
meiotrophic phenomena. In addition to uncovering every known cryptic gene for
Y. pestis, our analysis of the rhamnose fermentation pathway suggests that betB
is the responsible cryptic gene. Despite all of our medical advances, we still
do not have a vaccine for bubonic plague. Recent discoveries of antibiotic
resistant strains of Yersinia pestis coupled with the threat of plague being
used as a bioterrorism weapon compel us to develop new tools for studying the
physiology of this deadly pathogen. Using our theoretical model, we can study
the cells phenotypic behavior under different circumstances and identify

  distributions', e'Metabolic pathways are fundamental maps in biochemistry that detail how
molecules are transformed through various reactions. The complexity of
metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple
pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic balance changes over time or
after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method
to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a single
metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to
accurately infer the metabolic balance changes after different treatments in an
experiment. This study introduces a different concept: molecular weight
distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the molecular weights of
all metabolites of interest. By estimating the differences of the location and
scale estimates of these distributions, it becomes possible to quantitatively
infer the metabolic balance changes even without requiring knowledge of the

  identifies disruption of spatial hierarchy as a pathological driver event', e'Spatially annotated single-cell datasets provide unprecedented opportunities
to dissect cell-cell communication in development and disease. Heterotypic
signaling includes interactions between different cell types and is well
established in tissue development and spatial organization. Epithelial
organization requires several different programs that are tightly regulated.
Planar cell polarity is the organization of epithelial cells along the planar
axis orthogonal to the apical-basal axis. In this study, we investigate planar
cell polarity factors and explore the implications of developmental regulators
as malignant drivers. Utilizing cancer systems biology analysis, we derive gene
expression network for WNT-ligands (WNT) and their cognate frizzled (FZD)
receptors in skin cutaneous melanoma. The profiles supported by unsupervised
clustering of multiple-sequence alignments identify ligand-independent
signaling and implications for metastatic progression based on the underpinning
developmental spatial program. Omics studies and spatial biology connect
developmental programs with oncological events and explain key spatial features
of metastatic aggressiveness. Dysregulation of prominent planar cell polarity

include vital components to sustain growth and replication, and the resulting
cellular burden is a widely recognised bottleneck in the design of robust
circuits. In this tutorial we discuss the use of computational models that
integrate gene circuits and the physiology of host cells. Through various use
cases, we illustrate the power of host-circuit models to predict the impact of
design parameters on both burden and circuit functionality. Our approach relies
on a new generation of computational models for microbial growth that can

  Cells Powered and Controlled by Light', e'One of the major goals of nanobionics and bottom-up synthetic biology is the
development of artificial cell organelles for the creation of cell-like
structures operating similar to biological systems with a minimalistic set of
building blocks. In the present contribution, versatile strategies to develop
artificial reaction centers for novel photoautotrophic processes and to provide
fully biocompatible synthetic enzyme counterparts for stepwise sustrate
photo-conversion in abiotic organelles are summarized. This unique approach has

major cause of stroke and dementia, costing many lives and many billions of
pounds each year in the UK alone. This regulatory system, known as cerebral
autoregulation, has been the subject of much experimental and mathematical
investigation yet our understanding of it is still quite limited. One area in
which our understanding is particularly lacking is that of the role of nitric
oxide, understood to be a potent vasodilator. The interactions of nitric oxide
with the better understood myogenic response remain un-modelled and poorly
understood. In this thesis we present a novel model of the arteriolar control
mechanism, comprising a mixture of well-established and new models of
individual processes, brought together for the first time. We show that this
model is capable of reproducing experimentally observed behaviour very closely
and go on to investigate its stability in the context of the vasculature of the
whole brain. In conclusion we find that nitric oxide, although it plays a
central role in determining equilibrium vessel radius, is unimportant to the
dynamics of the system and its responses to variation in arterial blood
pressure. We also find that the stability of the system is very sensitive to

clearly demonstrates that prokaryotes and eukaryotes use strikingly different

malignancies is highly dependent on enhanced lipogenesis. De novo fatty-acid
synthesis permits accelerated proliferation of tumor cells by providing
structural components to build the membranes. It may also lead to alterations
of physicochemical properties of the formed membranes, which can have an impact
on signaling or even increase resistance to drugs in cancer cells. Cancer
type-specific lipid profiles would allow understanding the actual effects of
lipid changes and therefore could potentially serve as fingerprints for
individual tumors and be explored as diagnostic markers. We have used shotgun
MS approach to identify lipid patterns in different types of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients that either show no karyotype changes or belong to
t(8;21) or inv16 types. The observed differences in lipidomes of t(8;21) and
inv(16) patients, as compared to AML patients without karyotype changes,
concentrate mostly on substantial modulation of ceramides/sphingolipids
synthesis. Also significant changes in the physicochemical properties of the
membranes, between the t(8;21) and the other patients, were noted that were
related to a marked alteration in the saturation levels of lipids. The revealed

understanding protein synthesis and its deregulation in disease. While
ribosomes are believed to have a fixed stoichiometry among their core ribosomal
proteins (RPs), some experiments suggest a more variable composition. Testing
such variability requires direct and precise quantification of RPs. We used
mass-spectrometry to directly quantify RPs across monosomes and polysomes of
mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and budding yeast. Our data show that the
stoichiometry among core RPs in wild-type yeast cells and ESC depends both on
the growth conditions and on the number of ribosomes bound per mRNA.
Furthermore, we find that the fitness of cells with a deleted RP-gene is
